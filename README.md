# Library-System-with-Class

Introduction
In this assignment, you will enhance the library management program you previously developed. Instead of using a struct to represent a book, you will now use a class. The class will have member variables to store book data and member functions to manipulate this data. You will also add two new member functions.
The main functionalities remain the same: adding books to the library, searching for a book by author, searching for a book by title and displaying the books sorted by the author's last name. If multiple books have the same author, they will be sorted by their titles. You will implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort the books, the binary search algorithm to search for a book by the author, and the linear search algorithm to search by title.
The goal of this project is to help you understand how classes work in C++ and how they provide more functionality and control compared to structs.
We will provide you with the Book.h header file. You should implement your Book.cpp file according to that header file.
